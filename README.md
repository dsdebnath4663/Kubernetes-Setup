Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

```

free -h 
sudo -i
swapoff -a
free -h 
```


 Comment all line starting with swap :
```
vi /etc/fstab   
```

# Ubuntu OS Detais Check : -
```
cat /etc/os-release
```
# Install Docker using the repositoryðŸ”—

 Uninstall old versionsðŸ”—
```
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
 1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

 2.Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
3.Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```
# INSTALL DOCKER ENGINE
  Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:
```
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

 $ docker version
 ```
 Verify the MAC address and product_uuid are unique for every node :-
```
 sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid
 ```
 
# Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl :-

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
```

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl

```
 Configure Kubernetes Master : -

```
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

 Get ExternalIPs of all nodes
```
kubectl get nodes
```
